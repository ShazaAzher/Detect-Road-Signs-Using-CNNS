**Project Title: Road Sign Recognition System with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

**Overview:**
In this project, we aim to develop a road sign classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Road sign recognition is a critical component of autonomous driving systems and can greatly enhance road safety by assisting human drivers in adhering to traffic regulations. By leveraging computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms, we will build a model capable of accurately identifying and classifying various road signs.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Visualize a large image dataset containing road signs.
- Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training.
- Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data.
- Understand and analyze the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
- Develop and train a CNN architecture for road sign recognition.
